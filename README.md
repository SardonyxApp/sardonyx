## About

Sardonyx is an online solution to transform how high school students and teachers use technology to manage workloads. Sardonyx offers a cross-platfrom experience for all its users, through its mobile and web platforms. This repository contains code for Sardonyx's web application, targeted for computers and tablets.

The web application offers a group tasklist accessible by both teachers and students. Students and teachers benefit from the transparency of the workload, organized by due dates, subjects, and task categories. Each task on the list can be given a detailed description.

This repo is for the mobile application for iOS and Android, developed using React Native.
